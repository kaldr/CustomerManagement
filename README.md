# CustomerManagement
This is one of the important part of ERP project

## CRM vs CM
Our new CM extends the old CRM concept. In the old time, CRM system provides order management and customer profile modules for salors and customer servers. In this new CM, we offer real-time communication and big data operation systems.

## Technology In Use
### Meteor
### MongoDB
### AngularJS
### PHP
### Electron
### Ionic

## Code 
### Coffee
Although meteor has made itself a future framework which can adapt typescript in it, I still use coffee to enhance our development speed.
Some code style like 'import', 'other arguments' and 'export', which coffee is not perfectly adopted with the original javascript, are shown in meteor and can use another way to adapt to typescript. 

### Jade
Jade is a perfect html compile language.

### Stylus
Stylus is a perfect css compile language.
